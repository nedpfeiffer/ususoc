# Ready to Join?

We are glad you are on board and ready to get started in the club. Below are some quick ways you can get familiar with the club and get involved.

# Come to a club meeting

Club meetings are the main way everyone can participate in the club. We meet in the Huntsman on the Utah State Logan campus each week. Our meetings take place at 7 p.m. on Tuesday nights in room HH360. These meetings will be described each week in much more detail on our Discord server, so keep reading to get on there.

# Connect with us on Discord

Discord is our main format for communication. We send out announcements, meeting details, help answer members’ questions, chat about all things cyber, and grow our community. See the link in the footer of this page to hop on our Discord server.

# Get Kali Linux

Kali Linux is a specialized, open-source operating system designed for penetration testing and ethical hacking. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools and resources for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts to assess and secure computer systems, networks, and applications. We use this regularly, so we ask that you try to get it set up on your computer. If you are unable, no worries! Just talk to us, and we will help get something figured out so you can participate. We have plenty of options for getting you access to Kali; this way is just the simplest.

### Virtual Box

The first step is installing a hypervisor. We recommend Virtualbox because it is what we are familiar with and is free. Virtualbox will be the software that allows you to host your virtual Kali Linux machine on your computer. See the link below for instructions on how to install it. Basically, once you navigate to the link, select the operating system your computer has to find the appropriate installer.

### Kali Linux 

Once you have VirtualBox installed, you will set up your Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). Once you get Kali Linux set up, you will be ready and set up with many of the tools you will use and learn about while participating in this club. See the link below for a walkthrough. If you have any issues with the setup, feel free to DM a member of leadership or drop a comment in the ‘help-me’ section of our Discord.
