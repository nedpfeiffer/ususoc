This is the club leadership team from left to right: Joseph Johnson, Chandler McClellan, Chloe Clemens, Daniel Barfuss, and Scott Roberts.

* Chandler is the president of the club and oversees the club’s various activities and functions. Not only is he the Boss, but he is a boss.
* Chloe is the outreach and social media specialist. Handing everything from Instagram to advertisements around campus.
* Daniel handles our club’s various projects. Our website, along with many other projects, has been headed up by Daniel.
* Joseph coordinates the competitions and skill-building portion of the club.
* Lastly, Scott is the faculty advisor and is a true Cyber Pro. He has worked at many companies ranging from Hershey’s to Apple. He brings a wealth of experience and connections to the club that hardly anyone else could.
